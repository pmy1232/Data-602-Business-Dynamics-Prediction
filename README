Business Establishment Survival Classification

This project explores the feasibility of predicting business establishment survival using economic and geographic features from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics dataset. 
A binary classification method was developed to identify establishments with a survival rate greater than 50%, based on variables such as industry sector, employment trends, and firm size. 
Results from evaluation multiple models showed moderate predictive capacity of survival class (@ 69% accuracy) using a Random Forest Classification model, with little improvement after model tuning methods were applied.
Next steps include revising methodology for calculating survival rate, creating additonal engineered features, and improving data cleaning techniques.
